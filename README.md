## reduce_export
I maintain several web sites, which entails content turnover. Some content comes in PDF form, particularly 8.5 in. by 11 in. flyers. It has become tedious to repeat the operations necessary to convert a flyer to images suitable for a web page. The usual intent is to have an interested user click an image to bring up the full PDF, thereby reducing for most users the quantity of data coming from a server.

The list of all positive divisors of 850 is as follows: 1, 2, 5, 10, 17, 25, 34, 50, 85, 170, 425, 850. The List of all positive divisors of 100 is as follows: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 25, 44, 50, 55, 100, 110, 220, 275, 550, 1100. The common divisors are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50. The greatest common divisor is 50.

It is easy to see an incoming 850 px by 1100 px can be neatly converted to 255 px by 330 px without round off. I had been using a height of 360 px, but will convert to a height of 330 px for this special case of 8.5 in. by 11 in. content.
