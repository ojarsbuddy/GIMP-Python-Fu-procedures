# GIMP-Python-Fu-procedures
Here is a place to collect Python-Fu scripts, plug-ins, procedures (terminology appears to vary).

GIMP plug-ins live in ```C:\Users\ojars\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\2.10\plug-ins```.
```/home/ojars/.config/GIMP/2.10/plug-ins```.
```/usr/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins```.

Remember to restart GIMP, if changes are made to the register function. GIMP will see other changes to the code.
